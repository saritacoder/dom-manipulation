<!-- In this task you want to provide the user a facility that if he adds an item to the list by mistake, then he is able to remove it via a delete button.



Deliverables:

1. The 'li' that you are appending to the unordered list, make sure that it has a delete button.

2. When you click on that delete button, then that particular user's details should be removed from the screen and from the local storage.
